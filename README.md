# msteams-installer

Fetches and installs the latest version of Microsoft Teams for macOS.

### Requirements

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- `dockutil`, `pwsh` (PowerShell Core) â€” these will be auto-installed by Homebrew if missing

### Usage

Just run `./install-update-msteams.sh` from a Terminal.

The script will require elevated permissions, so `SUDO_ASKPASS` is recommended for non-interactive installs

Please report any issues!
